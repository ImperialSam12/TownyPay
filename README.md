# TownyPay

Created for my server TanukiCraft

A plugin that pays Mayors and Kings on every new Towny day and create a daily budget that can be spent.

On my server I have disabled bank withdrawals to prevent rogue Mayors/Kings and to make them manage their finances. To allow Mayors/Kings to focus on growing their towns/nations TownyPay creates a daily pay for them.
To allow Mayors/Kings to pay other players, TownyPay introduces a pay command to pay from the town/nation bank within a daily budget.

For Towny Admins:
Mayor and King pay can be configured to be either fixed or a percentage of the town profit.
Profit is calculated as CurrentBalance â€“ (Upkeep x ConfiguredNumber)
